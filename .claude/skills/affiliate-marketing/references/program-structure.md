# Program Structure

## Commission Models

### Recurring (Recommended for SaaS)
- Affiliates earn ongoing revenue as customer remains active
- Range: 15-50% of monthly subscription
- Industry average: 20-30%
- Example: ConvertKit 30% × $50/month = $15/month recurring

### One-Time
- Single payment for acquisition
- Used by Shopify ($150 fixed)
- Lower risk, simpler accounting
- Less attractive to quality affiliates

### Tiered Performance
```
Entry:    20% (0-50 referrals/month)
Mid:      30% (50-100 referrals/month)
Premium:  40%+ (100+ referrals/month)
```

### Hybrid (Base + Commission)
```
Base:     $2,000 retainer/month
Commission: 15% of subscription revenue
Bonus Tiers:
- 10+ customers/month = 20%
- 20+ customers/month = 25%
- 50+ customers/month = 30%
```

## Cookie Duration Strategy

| Duration | Best For | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| 30 days | Short sales cycles | Shopify |
| 60 days | B2C SaaS | ConvertKit |
| 90 days | B2B SaaS (standard) | HubSpot |
| 120 days | Enterprise, long sales | Semrush |
| 365 days | Premium positioning | AWeber |

## Two-Sided Incentives

**68% higher participation vs single-sided**

Patterns:
- **Symmetric:** "Give $20, Get $20"
- **Asymmetric:** "Give $100, Get $50" (higher recipient)
- **Product:** "Both get 500MB" (marginal cost, high value)

## CLV-Based Commission Calculation

```
Max Commission = CLV × 15% (typical allocation)

Example:
- Annual CLV: $2,400
- Max affiliate payout: $360/year (15%)
- Monthly commission: $30 (30% of $100/month)
```

## Hold Period Policy (Critical)

- **60-90 days** matching refund/chargeback window
- Pay only after hold expires + no refunds
- Typical SaaS: 90 days standard

## Minimum Payout Threshold

- Set $50-100 before first payment
- Deters opportunistic fraud
- Provides data accumulation time
