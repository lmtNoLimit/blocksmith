# Psychology Frameworks

## Octalysis Framework (8 Core Drives)

### White Hat (Intrinsic - Long-term)
1. **Epic Meaning:** Part of something bigger
   - Mechanics: Team challenges, community goals, social causes
   - Example: "Help plant 1000 trees together"

2. **Development & Accomplishment:** Progress, mastery
   - Mechanics: Levels, badges, progress bars, milestones
   - Example: "You've reached Gold status!"

3. **Empowerment of Creativity:** Choice, expression
   - Mechanics: Customization, multiple paths, user-generated
   - Example: "Design your own challenge"

### Black Hat (Extrinsic - Urgency)
4. **Ownership & Possession:** Accumulation, investment
   - Mechanics: Points, collections, virtual goods
   - Example: "Your 5,000 points waiting"

5. **Social Influence:** Competition, relatedness
   - Mechanics: Leaderboards, social proof, team play
   - Example: "3 friends beat your score"

6. **Scarcity & Impatience:** Limited, exclusive
   - Mechanics: Time limits, limited edition, waitlists
   - Example: "Only 24 hours left!"

7. **Unpredictability & Curiosity:** Variable rewards
   - Mechanics: Mystery boxes, random bonuses, easter eggs
   - Example: "Spin to reveal your reward"

8. **Loss & Avoidance:** Fear of missing out
   - Mechanics: Streaks, expiring points, limited offers
   - Example: "Don't lose your 7-day streak!"

## Self-Determination Theory (SDT)

| Need | Definition | Mechanics |
|------|------------|-----------|
| **Autonomy** | Control over actions | Choice in challenges, optional paths, customization |
| **Competence** | Feeling capable | Progressive difficulty, skill badges, clear feedback |
| **Relatedness** | Connection to others | Teams, social sharing, community recognition |

### Application
- Onboarding: High autonomy (choice), low difficulty (competence)
- Retention: Strong relatedness (community), visible progress (competence)
- Conversion: Autonomy (multiple offers), scarcity (urgency)

## Fogg Behavior Model

**B = MAT** (Behavior = Motivation x Ability x Trigger)

| Factor | Low | High |
|--------|-----|------|
| **Motivation** | No reward, irrelevant | Clear value, emotional appeal |
| **Ability** | Complex, time-consuming | Simple, one-click |
| **Trigger** | No prompt | Well-timed notification |

### Design Rules
1. If motivation high → can have harder tasks
2. If ability low → need stronger motivation
3. Always need clear trigger at right moment

## Variable Reward Schedules (Skinner)

| Schedule | Pattern | Engagement | Example |
|----------|---------|------------|---------|
| Fixed Ratio | Every N actions | Steady | "Buy 10, get 1 free" |
| Variable Ratio | Random after actions | Highest | "Spin to win (1-in-5 odds)" |
| Fixed Interval | Every N time | Moderate | "Daily login bonus" |
| Variable Interval | Random timing | High | "Flash sale alerts" |

**Best practice:** Variable ratio for highest engagement, fixed ratio for predictability.

## Flow State Design

```
Challenge Level
     High │    Anxiety    │    Flow Zone    │
          │               │   (Target!)     │
   Medium │   Boredom     │    Engaging     │
          │               │                 │
     Low  │   Apathy      │    Relaxation   │
          └───────────────┴─────────────────┘
            Low            High
                  Skill Level
```

**Rules:**
- New users: Low challenge, quick wins
- Engaged users: Progressive difficulty
- Power users: Expert challenges, mastery paths
- AI can dynamically adjust difficulty per user
