## Best Practices

1. **Clear phases** - Break into logical steps
2. **Agent assignment** - Who does what
3. **Quality gates** - Validation checkpoints
4. **Decision trees** - Handle branches
5. **Outputs defined** - Expected deliverables

## Integration Patterns

### Workflow → Agent
```markdown
## Phase 1: Research
**Agent:** researcher
**Skills:** docs-seeker, web-search
**Output:** Research report
```

### Workflow → Command
```markdown
## Quick Start
Run `/write:blog [topic]` to begin.
```

## Quality Gate Template

```markdown
## Quality Gates
### Before Phase 2
- [ ] Research complete
- [ ] Outline approved
- [ ] Keywords validated

### Before Publish
- [ ] SEO check passed
- [ ] Brand review done
- [ ] Links verified
```

## Decision Tree Pattern

```markdown
## Routing
Content type?
├── Blog → content-workflow
├── Email → email-workflow
├── Social → social-workflow
└── Landing page → content-workflow + design-workflow
```
