## Subject Lines (High Performers)
- "You get $50, they get $20 off"
- "3 friends signed up! Here's your $75"
- "Don't leave $100 on the table"
- "{{friend_name}} just used your link"

**Avoid:** "Exciting opportunity", "Invite friends today", generic lines

## Best Practices
- Lead with THEIR benefit, not yours
- Clear "you get/they get" messaging
- Single prominent CTA button
- Mobile-optimized (short lines, large buttons)
- Send at engagement peaks, not random times
