# Reward Structures

## Two-Sided Incentives (Recommended)

Both referrer AND referee receive rewards - drives 68% higher participation.

**Patterns:**
- Symmetric: "Give $20, Get $20" - Equal value both sides
- Asymmetric: "Give $100 to friend, Get $50" - Higher recipient incentive
- Product: "Both get 500MB storage" - Marginal cost, high perceived value

## Tiered/Milestone Rewards

Progression model encourages ongoing participation:

```
Tier 1: 1 referral  → $10 discount
Tier 2: 3 referrals → Free product
Tier 3: 5 referrals → $50 gift card
Tier 4: 10 referrals → Premium membership
```

**Example (Harry's):**
- 5 refs → Free shave cream
- 10 refs → Free razor
- 25 refs → Premium razor
- 50 refs → Year of free shaving

## Multi-Step Rewards

Reward at conversion milestones, not just signup:

```
$10 when referral schedules demo
$10 when they complete onboarding
$25 when they submit payment
```

**Benefits:** Reduces fraud, ensures genuine value, aligns with customer journey.

## Reward Type Comparison

| Type | Best For | Cost | Fraud Risk |
|------|----------|------|------------|
| Product credits | SaaS, cloud | Low (marginal) | Low |
| Cash/PayPal | Fintech | High (direct) | Medium |
| Discounts | Ecommerce | Medium | Medium |
| Gift cards | Retail | Medium | Medium |
| Free product | Physical goods | High | Low |
| VIP status | B2B, loyalty | Low | Very low |

## Real-World Examples

**Dropbox:**
- 500MB per referral (both parties)
- Max 16GB earnable
- Marginal cost, massive perceived value

**ASOS:**
- Referrer: 20% discount
- Referee: 20% discount
- Simple, equal incentive

**Dia & Co:**
- Both get $25
- Result: 40K shares month 1, 22 conversions/day

## Best Practices

1. **Non-cash > Cash:** 24% more effective at driving referrals
2. **Product alignment:** Rewards should match what you sell
3. **Clear messaging:** "You get X, they get Y" - no ambiguity
4. **Test amounts:** A/B test different reward values
5. **Cap fraud risk:** Multi-step or delayed rewards

## Anti-Patterns

- Single-sided rewards (only referrer benefits)
- Complex rules requiring explanation
- Rewards too small to motivate sharing
- Cash rewards for non-financial products
- No cap on self-referral abuse
