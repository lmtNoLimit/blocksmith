# Hook Writing Guide

Stop the scroll. Capture attention in the first 3 seconds.

## Why Hooks Matter

- 63% of high-CTR videos hook viewers within 3 seconds (TikTok for Business)
- Average human attention span: 8.25 seconds (25% decrease over 20 years)
- Hook determines whether content gets consumed or scrolled past

## Hook Psychology

### Cognitive Triggers

| Trigger | How It Works | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Curiosity Gap | Open loop that demands closure | "The reason your content fails isn't what you think" |
| Pattern Interrupt | Unexpected statement breaks autopilot | "Stop creating content. Start this instead." |
| Specificity | Concrete numbers feel credible | "I made $47,293 in 30 days using this" |
| Social Proof | Others validate the claim | "Why 10,000+ marketers use this daily" |
| Loss Aversion | Fear of missing out/losing | "This mistake is costing you $1000/month" |

## Hook Formulas by Type

### Curiosity Hooks

```

"Why doesn't anyone talk about [RELATED TO NICHE]?"
"This will change the way you [ACTION]"
"The dark secret behind [RELATED TO NICHE]"
"Everything you knew about [TOPIC] is wrong"
```

### Problem-Solution Hooks

```
"Struggling with [PAIN POINT]? Here's a secret tip I wish I knew earlier"
"Why 99% of [TARGET AUDIENCE] fail at [TOPIC]"
"This one mistake could be costing you [NUMBER]"
"If you're tired of [PAIN POINT], try this"

```

```

"Here's [NUMBER] underestimated [TIPS] to [RESULT]"
```

```

## Platform-Specific Hooks

### Twitter/X (280 chars)

**Best patterns:**
- Thread openers with curiosity gap
- Contrarian takes
- Hot takes with qualifiers

**Examples:**
```
"Unpopular opinion: [CONTRARIAN VIEW]"
"I spent 5 years learning [TOPIC]. Here's everything in one thread:"
"[THING] is overrated. Here's what actually works:"
```

### LinkedIn (Professional)

**Best patterns:**
- Data-driven insights
- Professional storytelling
- Thought leadership

**Examples:**
```
"After interviewing 100 [ROLE], I noticed a pattern..."
"[STATISTIC] of [AUDIENCE] struggle with [PROBLEM]. Here's why:"
"The best [ROLE] I know all do this one thing differently:"
```

### TikTok/Reels (3-second rule)

**Best patterns:**
- Visual + verbal hooks
- Bold claims
- Tension words (dangerous, secret, illegal)

**Examples:**
```
"POV: You just discovered [GAME-CHANGER]"
"These 3 [TIPS] feel illegal to know"
"Stop scrolling if you [TARGET AUDIENCE IDENTIFIER]"
```

### Instagram Carousel

**First slide hooks:**
```
"Save this before it's gone"
"The [TOPIC] cheat sheet you need"
"[NUMBER] things no one tells you about [TOPIC]"
```

## Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)

### Clickbait Language

**DON'T use:**
- "You won't BELIEVE..."
- "SHOCKING!"
- "This is INSANE!"
- "MIND-BLOWING!"
- "Everyone's talking about..."

**Why:** Erodes trust. Algorithms penalize engagement bait.

### Punching Keywords

**DON'T:**
- ALL CAPS for emphasis
- Excessive exclamation marks!!!
- Emoji spam in hooks

**Why:** Signals low-quality content. Professional audience scrolls past.

### Empty Promises

**DON'T:**
- Promise results you can't deliver
- Overhype mediocre content
- Use vague superlatives ("best ever", "game-changing")

**Why:** High bounce rate hurts reach. Damages credibility.

### Slow Starts

**DON'T:**
- "Hey guys, so today I wanted to talk about..."
- Long intros before value
- Explaining why you're making the content

**Why:** You have 3 seconds. Get to the point.

## Hook Quality Checklist

- [ ] Delivers value promise in first 3 seconds
- [ ] Targets specific audience pain point or desire
- [ ] Uses concrete numbers where applicable
- [ ] Creates open loop (curiosity gap)
- [ ] Matches content that follows (no bait-and-switch)
- [ ] Avoids clickbait/punching keywords
- [ ] Works without sound (for silent scrolling)

## Hook Testing Framework

1. **Create 3-5 hook variants** for same content
2. **Test on platform** (Stories, A/B test tools)
3. **Measure:**
   - Watch time / read time
   - Completion rate
   - Save/share rate (not just likes)
4. **Iterate** based on data

## Integration

Use these formulas with:
- `copywriting` skill - For body copy that delivers on hook promise
- `social-media` skill - For platform-specific formatting
- `/youtube:social` command - Applies hooks to video content
